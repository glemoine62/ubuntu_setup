# Ubuntu configuration and maintenance

These pages document ubuntu (16.04LTS) configuration and maintenance issues for the JRC RS Lab workstations. 

These workstations have limited sudo rights (security related), but generally allowing apt-get and pip installs and source builds. These pages serve to help maintain synchronized computing environments.

The configs are mostly related to use of image processing, geospatial analysis and machine learning solutions and specific to both the reduced rights and the use of specific hardware options, in particular the Quadro (M)4200 GPUs. Wherever relevant, the deviations from standard approaches proposed on the internet are documented.
